  <p>A balanced vegetarian diet should include a variety of foods from different food groups to ensure that all necessary nutrients are obtained. This can include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A variety of fruits and vegetables for vitamins and minerals</li>
    <li>Whole grains for carbohydrates and fiber</li>
    <li>Protein-rich foods, such as beans, nuts, and soy products</li>
    <li>Healthy fats from nuts, seeds, and avocado</li>
  </ul>
